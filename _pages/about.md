I am a passionate master student from South China University of Technology. My Interests includes unsupervised learning, computer vision and representation learning. I am especially obsessed about exploring the intrinsic characteristics of neural networks, and facilitate them for deeper comprehension and better applications on artificial intelligence.

I received both of my M.E. and B.E. from South China University of Technology under the supervision of [Si Wu](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/2017/0129/c22285a327623/page.htm). 

I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position on theory bridging representation learning, loss function and network architecture together. If you are interested, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:csliguanyue007@mail.scut.edu.cn).
