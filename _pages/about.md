I am a passionate master student from South China University of Technology. My Interests includes unsupervised learning, computer vision and representation learning. I am especially obsessed about exploring the intrinsic characteristics of neural networks, and facilitate them for deeper comprehension and better applications on artificial intelligence.

I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position on theory bridging representation learning, loss function and network architecture together.
