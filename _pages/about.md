*This is a passionate master student from South China University of Technology*.

My research interests include unsupervised learning, computer vision and representation learning. I am especially obsessed about exploring the intrinsic characteristics of neural networks, and deploy them for a deeper comprehension and better application on the artificial intelligence.

I received both of my M.E. and B.E. from South China University of Technology under the supervision of [Si Wu](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/cs/2017/0129/c22285a327623/page.htm). 

I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position on theory bridging representation learning, loss function and network architecture together. If you are interested, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:csliguanyue007@mail.scut.edu.cn).
