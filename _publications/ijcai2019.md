excerpt:
    <p>Autoencoders enjoy a remarkable ability to learn data representations. Research on autoencoders shows that the effectiveness of data interpolation can reflect the performance of representation learning. However, existing interpolation methods in autoencoders do not have enough capability of traversing a possible region between datapoints on a data manifold, and the distribution of interpolated latent representations is not considered. To address these issues, we aim to fully exert the potential of data interpolation and further improve representation learning in autoencoders. Specifically, we propose a multidimensional interpolation approach to increase the capability of data interpolation by setting random interpolation coefficients for each dimension of the latent representations. In addition, we regularize autoencoders in both the latent and data spaces, by imposing a prior on the latent representations in the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) framework and encouraging generated datapoints to be realistic in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. Compared to representative models, our proposed approach has empirically shown that representation learning exhibits better performance on downstream tasks on multiple benchmarks. </p>
