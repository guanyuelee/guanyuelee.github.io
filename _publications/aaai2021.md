Problem Describtion
======
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved considerable success in high fidelity image synthesis and downstream applications, such as [PGGAN](), [StyleGAN](), [BigGAN]() and so on. But GAN has no way to inference for the latent code, which leads to the development of GAN inversion in these years. GAN inversion aims to reverse a target image back to a code in the latent space such that the inverted code can be as close to the target image as possible. 

Formally speaking, given a pre-trained generator $G$ and a target image $x$, we are required to find an optimal latent code $z$, such that $x = G(z)$.
